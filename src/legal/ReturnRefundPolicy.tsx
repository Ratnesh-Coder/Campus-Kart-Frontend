            <p>
              When a seller lists an item, RebuZZar reviews and approves it before publication.
              Buyers can book items they wish to purchase. RebuZZar notifies the seller of the booking
              and arranges item pickup. The buyer is informed of the delivery schedule.
              At delivery, the buyer inspects the item. If satisfied, payment is made at that time.
              RebuZZar deducts its commission <strong>(10% of the selling price)</strong> and transfers the remaining funds to the seller within 48 hours.
              <br />
              Example: If an item sells for ‚Çπ100, RebuZZar deducts ‚Çπ10 as commission and transfers ‚Çπ90 to the seller.

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-1">2. Returns and Refunds</h2>
            <p>
              Returns are only permitted at the time of delivery if the item is damaged, defective,
              or materially different from the description. Once the buyer accepts the item and makes
              payment, the sale is final. No returns, exchanges, or refunds are allowed after payment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Refunds are processed only in cases of pre-payment rejection at delivery. For all other
              transactions, buyer payments are final, and seller payouts <strong>(after 10% commission deduction)</strong> are 
              made within 48 hours of payment.

            <p>
              RebuZZar charges a <strong>10%</strong> commission on successful sales. The commission is deducted from the
              buyer‚Äôs payment before transferring the remaining amount to the seller.

              Buyers may reject items at delivery if they are damaged, defective, or not as described.
              Any returned item is sent back to the seller in its original condition.
